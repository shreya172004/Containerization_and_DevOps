## 1. Aim

To design and implement a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, integrating source code from GitHub, and building & pushing Docker images to Docker Hub.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Understand CI/CD workflow using Jenkins (GUI-based tool)
- Create a structured GitHub repository with application + Jenkinsfile
- Build Docker images from source code
- Securely store Docker Hub credentials in Jenkins
- Automate build & push process using webhook triggers
- Use same host (Docker) as Jenkins agent

---

## 3. Theory

### What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is a web-based GUI automation server used to:
- Build applications
- Test code
- Deploy software

It provides:
- Dashboard (browser-based UI)
- Plugin ecosystem (GitHub, Docker, etc.)
- Pipeline as Code using `Jenkinsfile`

### What is CI/CD?

**Continuous Integration (CI):** Code is automatically built and tested after each commit.

**Continuous Deployment (CD):** Built artifacts (Docker images) are automatically delivered/deployed.

### Workflow Overview

```
Developer → GitHub → Webhook → Jenkins → Build → Docker Hub
```

---

## 4. Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- GitHub account
- Docker Hub account
- Basic Linux command knowledge

---

## 5. Part A: GitHub Repository Setup

### 5.1 Project Structure

```
my-app/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── Dockerfile
├── Jenkinsfile
```

### 5.2 Application Code — `app.py`

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello from CI/CD Pipeline!"

app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=80)
```

### 5.3 `requirements.txt`

```
flask
```

### 5.4 Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### 5.5 Jenkinsfile

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        IMAGE_NAME = "your-dockerhub-username/myapp"
    }
    stages {
        stage('Clone Source') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-username/my-app.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME:latest .'
            }
        }
        stage('Login to Docker Hub') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'dockerhub-token', variable: 'DOCKER_TOKEN')]) {
                    sh 'echo $DOCKER_TOKEN | docker login -u your-dockerhub-username --password-stdin'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Push to Docker Hub') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker push $IMAGE_NAME:latest'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 6. Part B: Jenkins Setup using Docker

### 6.1 `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  jenkins:
    image: jenkins/jenkins:lts
    container_name: jenkins
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "50000:50000"
    volumes:
      - jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    user: root

volumes:
  jenkins_home:
```

### 6.2 Start Jenkins

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Access Jenkins at: `http://localhost:8080`

### 6.3 Unlock Jenkins

```bash
docker exec -it jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

### 6.4 Initial Setup

- Install suggested plugins
- Create admin user (`ShreyaMahara`)

---

## 7. Part C: Jenkins Configuration

### 7.1 Add Docker Hub Credentials

Path: `Manage Jenkins → Credentials → Add Credentials`
- **Type:** Secret Text
- **ID:** `dockerhub-token`
- **Value:** Docker Hub Access Token

### 7.2 Create Pipeline Job

1. `New Item → Pipeline`
2. **Name:** `ci-cd-pipeline`
3. Configure:
   - Pipeline script from SCM
   - SCM: Git
   - Repo URL: your GitHub repo
   - Script Path: `Jenkinsfile`

---

## 8. Part D: GitHub Webhook Integration

### 8.1 Configure Webhook

In GitHub: `Settings → Webhooks → Add Webhook`
- **Payload URL:** `http://<your-server-ip>:8080/github-webhook/`
- **Events:** Push events

### 8.2 Exposing Jenkins via LocalTunnel

Since Jenkins runs locally, we used `localtunnel` to expose it publicly for GitHub webhook integration:

```bash
npm install -g localtunnel
npx localtunnel --port 8080
```

This generated a public URL (e.g., `https://green-donuts-nail.loca.lt`) which was used as the webhook payload URL.

---

## 9. Part E: Execution Flow

| Stage | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Code Push** | Developer pushes code to GitHub |
| **Webhook Trigger** | GitHub sends event to Jenkins |
| **Clone** | Jenkins pulls latest code from GitHub |
| **Build** | Docker builds image using Dockerfile |
| **Auth** | Jenkins logs into Docker Hub using stored token |
| **Push** | Image pushed to Docker Hub |
| **Done** | Docker image available globally |

---

## 10. Role of Same Host Agent

Jenkins runs inside Docker with the Docker socket mounted:

```
/var/run/docker.sock
```

This allows Jenkins to directly control the host's Docker daemon — building and pushing images without needing a separate agent node.


---

## 11. Observations

- Jenkins GUI significantly simplifies CI/CD pipeline management
- GitHub acts as both source repository and pipeline definition store (via `Jenkinsfile`)
- Docker ensures consistent, reproducible builds across environments
- Webhook integration enables fully automated, event-driven pipelines
- `localtunnel` provides a quick way to expose local Jenkins to the internet for webhook testing
- The Docker socket mount allows Jenkins to control the host Docker engine directly

---

## 12. Result

Successfully implemented a complete CI/CD pipeline where:
- Source code and pipeline definition are maintained in GitHub
- Jenkins automatically detects code changes via GitHub webhook
- Docker image is built on the host agent
- Image is securely pushed to Docker Hub using stored credentials

---

## 14. Viva Questions

**Q1. What is the role of Jenkinsfile?**
It defines the CI/CD pipeline as code, stored in the repository alongside the application source.

**Q2. How does Jenkins integrate with GitHub?**
Through GitHub Webhooks — GitHub sends a POST request to Jenkins on every push event, triggering the pipeline automatically.

**Q3. Why is Docker used in CI/CD?**
Docker ensures consistent, reproducible builds across different environments by packaging the application and its dependencies into an image.

**Q4. What is a webhook?**
A webhook is an HTTP callback that allows GitHub to notify Jenkins of events (like a push) in real time.

**Q5. Why store Docker Hub token in Jenkins credentials?**
To avoid hardcoding secrets in the Jenkinsfile, which is stored in a public/shared repository. Jenkins credentials store is encrypted and secure.

**Q6. What is the benefit of using the same host as agent?**
Jenkins can directly invoke Docker commands on the host, eliminating the need for a separate build agent and simplifying the setup.

---

## 15. Key Takeaways

- Jenkins is GUI-based but pipelines are fully code-driven via `Jenkinsfile`
- Always use the credentials store — **never hardcode secrets**
- Webhooks make CI/CD fully automatic and event-driven
- Docker socket mounting (`/var/run/docker.sock`) allows Jenkins to act as its own Docker agent
- `localtunnel` is a quick solution for exposing local services during development/testing
